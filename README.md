<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The website allows users to design and test finite automatons.

You can create a new state by double clicking anywhere on the canvas. You can also drag it around the canvas by clicking and holding. A single click will allow you to edit the name of the state or delete it by pressing the Delete key on your keyboard.
The value of any state is either True or False, with the latter being the default. You can switch between these by double clicking on a state.

By pressing Shift, you can connect two different states and then add a transition character between them. You can also click on these transitions at any time to edit them or delete them with the Delete key on your keyboard.

To reassign the initial state, just click and hold a state without dragging it around for a couple seconds. This state can be easily identified as the only state with a blue name.

On the left sidebar, you can type in and test different strings, either one at a time (test sample) or with multiple test cases (bulk testing). Results will be displayed after pressing the corresponding 'Test' button.

All of your process will be saved next time you enter.

These functionalities will improve in the future.
